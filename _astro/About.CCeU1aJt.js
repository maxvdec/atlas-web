### **Words from the Creator**

I am the creator of Atlas, Max Van den Eynde, I designed the original concept and architecture of the engine, and I continue to lead its development and evolution. My vision is to create an engine that not only meets the technical demands of modern game development but also fosters a vibrant community of users who can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and push the boundaries of what is possible in gaming. Through continuous innovation and a commitment to excellence, the Atlas Engine Project aims to become a leading force in the game development world, enabling creators to bring their visions to life with unparalleled ease and efficiency.

I have always loved video games since I was a child. Growing up, I spent countless hours immersed in virtual worlds, captivated by the stories, characters, and experiences they offered. This passion for gaming eventually led me to pursue a career in game development, where I could combine my love for technology and creativity to bring new experiences to life. The first language I learned was C#, since I wanted to create video games with Unity. Then, I learned that systems and algorithms fascinated me, so I started learning C++, Zig and low-level programming. Then I discovered graphics programming and real-time rendering, which led me to create the Atlas Engine. This actually is the fifth try at creating a game engine, after learning from my mistakes and previous projects. With Atlas, I aim to provide developers with a robust and flexible engine that simplifies the game development process while delivering high performance and stunning visuals. My goal is to empower creators to bring their ideas to life and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of the gaming industry. I wanted to offer a fresh perspective on game engines, I wanted to move out from the typical clunky UI and complicated workflows that other engines have. I wanted to create something that is both powerful and easy to use, so that developers can focus on what they do best: creating amazing games.

We are just getting started, and there is so much more to come. I am excited to see how the Atlas Engine Project will evolve and grow in the coming years, and I look forward to collaborating with developers and creators from around the world to shape the future of game development. Together, we can create incredible experiences that inspire and captivate players everywhere.

Keep on creating,
*Max Van den Eynde*
