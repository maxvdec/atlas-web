# Alpha 5 Released!

It's been a long time without a new release, but we're excited to announce that Atlas Engine Alpha 5 is now available! This release brings a host of new features, improvements, and bug fixes that enhance the overall experience for developers using the engine.

## The Amazing Website

One of the standout features of this release is the launch of our brand-new website! The website serves as a central hub for all things Atlas Engine, providing developers with easy access to documentation, tutorials, and resources. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, the website has something for everyone.

This is it! We think that the style really fits our vibe, since it looks modern but friendly. We hope to keep on improving it over time, adding more content and features to help our community thrive.

## Multiplatform Support

So, we've tested Atlas Engine Alpha 5 on macOS and Linux and it looks great on both! We're committed to providing a seamless experience across different platforms, and this release is a significant step towards that goal. Whether you're developing on Windows, macOS, or Linux, you can expect consistent performance and functionality.

## Opal with Vulkan

The most exciting addition in Alpha 5 is the implementation of Vulkan support in the Opal rendering backend. This new feature unlocks advanced graphics capabilities and improved performance on supported hardware. Developers can now take advantage of Vulkan's low-level access to the GPU, enabling them to create stunning visual effects and immersive experiences.

You can read about the Vulkan implementation in more detail in our [development blog post](https://atlasengine.org/news/migrated-to-opal/).

## What's Next?

As we continue to develop Atlas Engine, we have several exciting features and improvements planned for future releases. Our team is dedicated to enhancing the engine's capabilities, optimizing performance, and expanding platform support. We encourage our community to provide feedback and suggestions to help shape the future of Atlas Engine.

But we aren't stopping here! We can say a bit about what's coming in Alpha 6, since our roadmap is going to be published soon. Expect to see:

- Our macOS app for debugging and testing called 'Atlas Tracer' which will make development on macOS much easier with features like live performance profiling and tracing.
- Solved problems with the Vulkan backend, which right now is in an experimental state.
- Jolt integration for physics simulation, bringing robust and efficient physics capabilities to Atlas Engine.

That's everything for now! We hope you enjoy using Atlas Engine Alpha 5 and exploring the new features it brings. Stay tuned for more updates and announcements as we continue to push the boundaries of game development with Atlas Engine. Happy coding!
